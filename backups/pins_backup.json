The Maze is accessed via a 100 metre-long suspension bridge from the Entertainment Centre, and offers some of the most spectacular views of the resort, particularly of The Palace of the Lost City and the Gary Player Golf Course. When night falls, flaming torches light the paths along the chambers. At the end of The Maze of the Lost City is the Maze Bar that has a selection of ice-cold craft beers on tap. The craft beer menu is updated regularly so you can always expect something new at this unique Sun City maze bar.<\/p><p>This Sun City maze can be hired out for private parties, conferences or as a dining area, hosting up to 200 people.<\/p>",

Gary Player was called upon again to extend his professional expertise by designing the golf course. Covered in the hardy Kikuyu grass, much like the Gary Player Country Club golf course at Sun City, the course offers undulating plains, expansive fairways, mountainous areas and small patches of desert. This superlative golf course also offers players a distinctive region covered with a series of lakes that separate the 9th from the final hole. The 13th hole offers a green in the shape of the African continent, complete with a pond that is home to numerous Nile Crocodiles; adding to the true African appeal of this course.<\/p>",

The Maze of the Lost City was added to Sun City Resort in September 2012 and covers a half-acre. The Maze is accessed via a 100 metre-long suspension bridge from the Entertainment Centre and offers some of the most spectacular views of the resort, particularly of The Palace of the Lost City and the Gary Player Golf Course. When night falls, flaming torches light the paths along the chambers. At the end of The Maze of the Lost City is the Maze Bar that has a selection of ice-cold craft beers on tap. The craft beer menu is updated regularly so you can always expect something new at this unique Sun City maze bar. This Sun City maze can be hired out for private parties, conferences or as a dining area, hosting up to 200 people.<\/p>",

When night falls, flaming torches light the paths along the chambers. At the end of The Maze of the Lost City is the Maze Bar that has a selection of ice-cold craft beers on tap.

Guests feel indulged and cared for with splendid luxury, passionate service, generous hospitality and exquisite cuisine. We offer the ideal escape where harmony and tranquillity gently restore body, mind and soul. We are dedicated to restoring beauty and balance through individual treatments and spa journeys, personalised for each of our guests by exceptionally skilled therapists. Our commitment to wellbeing focuses on holistic principles, combining ancient wisdom and modern expertise.<\/p><p>Hydrotherapy Pools:<br\/>WARM, COOL &amp; FLOTATION<br\/>Incorporating water jets at the optimal temperature for rebalancing your body\u2019s metabolism, use of our warm and cold plunge pools is available to all spa guests inclusive of your treatment. In addition you may also like to try a complimentary session in our unique Salt Water Flotation Pool. Offering a liquid, reduced gravity experience, floating in the salty water eases jetlag and results in maximum relaxation - research has shown that just 20 minutes is equivalent to a full two hours of sleep.<\/p><p>Indoor Treatment Rooms:<br\/>7 DUAL AND SINGLE TREATMENT ROOMS<br\/>Our extensive spa facilities include seven superbly equipped indoor treatment rooms with rain showers, for dual and single treatments. The rooms have been designed to offer a serene, calming ambiance, with heated treatment beds, fluffy towels, scented candles and relaxing music. They are the perfect retreat for both hotel guests and day spa visitors wishing to enjoy a selection of personalised individual treatments or exclusive Spa Journeys.<\/p><p>Outdoor Mountain Gazebos:<br\/>2 GAZEBOS WITH ATLANTIC SEA VIEWS<br\/>While the interior of The Spa is exceptional, The Twelve Apostles\u2019 unique position on the mountains overlooking the Atlantic Ocean means that a sunset massage in one of two outdoor gazebos is an absolutely unforgettable experience. It is the perfect place for couples to escape and have a side-by-side massage surrounded by nature, with the Atlantic stretching into the horizon in front of you for as far as the eye can see. Please note that the gazebos cater for massage treatments only.<\/p><p>Rasul Chamber and Rain Shower:<br\/>TRADITIONAL ARABIC CLEANSING RITUAL CHAMBER<br\/>Our Rasul Chamber offers a traditional Arabic cleansing ritual through the use of gentle steam and mud. This relaxing skin-smoothing self-treatment blends mineral-rich mud, steam and heat to provide an experience that cleanses, releases toxins and rejuvenates. The self-applied mud hardens in dry heat, allowing the skin to draw out impurities from the body. As the mud softens again, its beneficial ingredients and natural minerals are further absorbed by the body. A gentle rain shower signals the end of the programme, leaving you with glowing skin. The ritual is recommended for enjoyment with a partner.<\/p><p>Health Bar Buffet &amp; Menu:<br\/>Homemade healthy snacks<br\/>Spa guests may take advantage of our complimentary Health Bar buffet during their time at The Spa, with a selection of healthy homemade snacks, fresh fruit juices and still mineral water. For something more substantial we also offer an exclusive Spa Menu at an additional cost, featuring delicious, wholesome meals conducive to a healthy lifestyle.<\/p><p>Tranquility Lounge:<br\/>RELAX BETWEEN &amp; AFTER TREATMENTS<br\/>To make the most of your time at The Spa, recline and relax on a comfortable lounge chair in our Tranquility Lounge, in-between and after spa treatments. Sip herbal tea, browse a selection of magazines, read a book or simply close your eyes and meditate. It\u2019s the perfect way to complete your spa journey.<\/p>",
